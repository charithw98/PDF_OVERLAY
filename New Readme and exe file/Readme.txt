## **Installation Guide**

### **Step 1: Clone the Project**

First, download the project files by cloning the GitHub repository.

1. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the folder where you want to clone the project:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\your\desired\folder
   ```

2. Run the following Git command to clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PDF_OVERLAY.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd PDF_OVERLAY
   ```

### **Step 2: Install Python and Pip**

1. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Ensure you check the option to **Add Python to PATH** during the installation.

2. Open Command Prompt and check if Python and `pip` are installed correctly:
   ```bash
   python --version
   pip --version
   ```

### **Step 3: Install Project Dependencies**

In the project folder, run the following command to install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there is no `requirements.txt` file, you can install each dependency manually:
```bash
pip install openpyxl
pip install msoffcrypto-tool
```

## **Creating a `.exe` File**

To create an executable (.exe) file for the project, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Install PyInstaller**

1. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\PDF_OVERLAY
   ```

2. Install **PyInstaller** using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

### **Step 2: Create the Executable**

1. Run the following command in the project directory to create a single `.exe` file:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile src/main.py
   ```

2. After running the command, PyInstaller will create a `dist` folder inside the project directory. This folder contains the executable `.exe` file.

### **Step 3: Run the Executable**

Navigate to the `dist` folder, and youâ€™ll find the generated executable. You can run it by double-clicking the `.exe` file or from the command line:
```bash
.\dist\main.exe
```

---

## **Running the Application**

After creating the `.exe` file, you can run the application directly without installing Python.

If you are running the Python project directly (without an `.exe`), follow these steps:

1. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the project folder.
2. Run the main Python script:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

---

## **Dependencies**

The project uses several Python libraries. If you're developing or running the project, ensure these dependencies are installed:

- `tkinter`: For GUI elements.
- `openpyxl`: For working with Excel files.
- `msoffcrypto`: For handling encrypted Microsoft Office files.
- `PyInstaller`: For creating executable files (used during the build process).

To install the dependencies manually:
```bash
pip install tkinter openpyxl msoffcrypto-tool
```

---

## **Troubleshooting**

1. **`pip` is not recognized**: Ensure Python and `pip` are correctly added to your system's PATH. You can verify by running `python --version` and `pip --version` in Command Prompt.

2. **Missing modules error**: If you encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError`, run:
   ```bash
   pip install <missing_module_name>
   ```

3. **Error during `.exe` creation**: Ensure all dependencies are installed. If PyInstaller fails, make sure your Python scripts are running correctly before attempting to compile them.
